The Quarrel Game Framework üí•

Quarrel Game Framework is a lightweight framework built as an attempt to advance the Roblox
fighting-game scene as a whole by abstracting away the most difficult parts of 
fighting-game development such as ***Rollback***, thus allowing the developer to
focus on the more important things like _world design_ and _fun_.

As a fighting game framework, this framework tries to preserve one ideal in order to make
the development experience worthwhile and as streamlined as possible:

1. A fighting game made with this framework should have as little boilerplate as possible
with as much function as possible. We're talking _no more than five modules_ to get your
game **up-and-running and playable**.

2. We **need** to stay in our own lane. It is very likely that developers want to have
other functionalities on the side and we shouldn't impede on that. Singletons and
components should turn on and off seamlessly with no visible artifacts.

3. Customization above all. If we leave developers yearning for what _should have been_
instead of _what could have been_, we did something wrong. Points of contention should
be amongst the developers, not us.

With that said, here's what we have in store as of now:

* [x] Input Registry
* [x] Frame Data
* [x] Attack Execution
* [x] Custom Characters and Movesets
